# Prisoner's Game

Rules: The game is played with two players, and is similar to ​​another game called "31" but without a deck. In the game, drawing a card corresponds to both players showing a number with their fingers at the same time from 1 to 5. The two numbers are added together and this is the value of the "card" the player drew. When playing, a player "draws cards" until his points are at least 26. If he exceeds 31 points he "gets burned". Players take turns playing. If the first player gets "burned", the second player wins. If the second one "gets burned" the first one wins. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins. If they have the same number, the first player wins. They players play multiple rounds and alternate who is first and who is second. In the end, the one who has won the most rounds wins.
